                                My bachelor's degree existed at the intersection of journalism and visual design. Ethical journalism was 
                                heavily involved in my education, which led to my core belief that my work should always be honest and ethical.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ethical journalism also trained me to seek out reliable, reputable and truthful sources when I seek knowledge or when faced
                                with a decision that will affect the user.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                When considering potential solutions to a problem, I give weight to and consider best practices that have been proven through 
                                research or rigorous study.
                            </p>

                                Neilsen Norman Group and The Interaction Design Foundation are my sources of truth when I need knowledge or inspiration.
                                My sources of truth also help me make a decision and advocate for that decision.

                            As a genuinely curious knowledge-seeker, I'm on an endless pursuit for knowledge.
                            I firmly believe that no matter how much one may already know, there is always more knowledge to be found.
                            The more perspectives you hear, the more your knowledge grows and thus you can better empathize with a variety of users.

                        <p>
                            It is of utmost importance to me that my knowledge is up-to-date and well-rounded.
                            When I notice an area I may have limited knowledge of or an area I think will permit me to help users more effectively,
                            I seek out articles, studies, books and more to educate myself and grow as a designer.

                            <p>In summer 2024, I read Laws of UX by Jon Yablonski. I found this book to be very informative and I found myself able to put into words the things I was already doing that I knew were beneficial for users.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy digital journaling on my iPad and I wanted a reference for everything I learned in this book so I created a notebook in Goodnotes.</p>

                            Actively seeking out and listening to input from a variety of users, peers and stakeholders is essential to my process.
                            Humans are complex. We have unique personalities, experiences and behaviors. We all have a story to tell.

                            <p>
                            I believe in figuring out a process that is comfortable for everyone while also being efficient.
                            I'm respectful of personality types and I accommodate them where I can. When I notice someone hasn't had a chance
                            to say something, I invite them in to the conversation by asking for their input.

                            I encourage time to think independently, because not everyone feels comfortable speaking up.
                            The best experiences happen when we gather a diverse pool of ideas. 
                                The more we accommodate for differences, the closer we are to a solution that works for every user.
