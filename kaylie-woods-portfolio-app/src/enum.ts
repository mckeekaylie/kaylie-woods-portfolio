    para1 = "I graduated from Ball State University cum laude in 2018 with a major in Journalism Graphics (graphic design) and a minor in Digital Publishing (printing). During my time at Ball State, I completed 4 marketing graphic design internships in addition to freelance design work and 2 community projects with my journalism department peers. I was introduced to HTML and CSS my freshman year during an intro to visual communication course, and I was immediately fascinated with coding and interested in pursuing it. I took 2 computer science courses in addition to the course in my major that focused on JavaScript.",
    para2 = "Post-graduation, I worked full-time as a graphic designer then transitioned to a UI designer / IT catch-all role. This was a step in the right direction, but I felt like something was missing in my day-to-day. I decided to go all-in on front-end development, investing in Blaizing Academy's Web Development Bootcamp in 2020.",
    para3 = "Upon graduation from Blaizing Academy, I was hired as UI/UX Developer at TCC Solutions. My time at TCC allowed my creativity and blossoming technical skills to bloom and thrive.",
    para4 = "After departing TCC in 2022, I started working at Genesys as Software Engineer. As a member of the Analytics UI team, I developed features and views that boost the user experience in Genesys Cloud, providing valuable metrics and insights to call center managers. Unlike my previous roles, this one was solely technical. This focus on TypeScript, JavaScript frameworks, integration/unit testing, and peer review substantially enhanced my knowledge and skill in the front-end development realm.",
    para5 = "In September 2023, I started working for ProRank as an Angular Developer, coding front-end enhancements and features with Angular 15. When a need for a UI designer arose, I stepped up and assumed responsibility for ideation, wireframe, and hi-fidelity mockups while bringing my designs to life in the Angular respository. My design and development work, in tandem with my peers, pushed ProRank through MVP, which led the company on the journey to landing their first client in 2024. As new developers were added to the team, of my own volition, I took responsibility of onboarding, training and mentoring them. I saw a need to set new front-end developers up for success and I wanted to help them get up-and-running quickly while ensuring they knew they could come to me with any blockers.",
    para6 = "My time at ProRank has come to an end, but I am now eagerly awaiting my next adventure as a Design Engineer."
