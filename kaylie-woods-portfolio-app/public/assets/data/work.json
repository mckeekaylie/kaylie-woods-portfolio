I was accountable for implementing front-end features and enhancements with Angular 16. As time progressed, I eagerly assumed responsibility for UX and UI design and front-end developer mentorship. I was a key voice in the ideation discussions behind MVP and I brought these discussions to fruition in wireframes and high-fidelity mockups. Once the designs were approved, I tackled the Angular development required to bring them to life in the product. My design and engineering efforts during MVP established ProRank’s new look and the direction of the product, which led to the signing of ProRank’s first client.",
