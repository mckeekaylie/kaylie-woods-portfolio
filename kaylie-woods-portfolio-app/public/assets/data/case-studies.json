If the recruiter finds an excellent candidate whom they wish to keep in mind for future roles, it is up to the recruiter to remember the candidate’s name and information. Recruiters either have to manually search for the candidate via the search bar at the top of ProRank or store the candidate in a place outside of ProRank.",

The view will be named Talent Communities and it will consist of a landing page that is split into two tabs, Communities (all) and Members (all). Additionally, there will be a modal accessible via the edit button on a community that enables the user to view and edit a community’s details. This modal consists of two tabs: Details and Members. I am provided with requirements and simple drawings via a Miro board to give me an idea of the expectations for the layout. It is my responsibility to translate the requirements and the drawing into a new user interface.",

From there, I start connecting the pieces by moving them to different locations on the frame. I start by placing pieces where my initial instinct tells me to. I carefully consider the placement and move pieces around until the placement makes sense, establishes visual hierarchy, and aligns with existing patterns."

For example, in other views of ProRank, I followed a pattern: accordions = indigo; decorative icons = green;  create/new buttons = green. I put these rules into place because patterns aid the user with identifying and understanding the options they have on the screen. If all create/new buttons are green, the user will learn that green = create/new, thus making it easier for them to locate what they want to interact with."

For these sessions, I create a Miro board with frames detailing the context of the design and what the goals of the session are. After reviewing the context and goals with attendees, I set a timer and give everyone time to process the designs and add sticky notes under positive feedback, ideas and concerns buckets. Once the timer is up, I walk through each sticky note with the team, allowing all attendees to present ideas for the sticky note. The session is wrapped up by establishing action items. In the following days, I implement all action items and get a final approval"
